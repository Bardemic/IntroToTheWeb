Windy City Hackathon Project - 100% Solo

Link: http://os08gso.172.234.221.142.sslip.io/

How to use:

I created a test login (email: WindycityTest@gmail.com, Password: Windy123) to log in. Once logged in,
you can open the sections page by clicking "Get Started." Click the only avaiable current section, then it will tell you
about it. You can then click begin. In the currently available section, you need to get the box to the square using CSS.
Each dotted line is a line of CSS you can edit of the overall container. Once you got it correct, the next question will open.
This project uses Supabase as a backend/database, and your progress will be stored there.

My Stack for this project was NextJS (using TS), Tailwind, Supabase, and ShadCN
